Operators
=========

Operators are graph nodes taking homogeonously typed arguments and
returning a value prescribed by the input types. Just like NumPy
they are generally type and shape ad-hoc polymorphic.

The method by which we determine which low-level kernel to dispatch the
operator to is determined by the typechecker as a function of the
input types of the operator.

Operators also have a variety of properties that optionally can be used
to be inform specializtion and expression graph rewriting for domain
experts. ( Not all are defined for every operator. )
