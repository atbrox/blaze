=============
Memory Layout
=============

A chunked array behaves similar to a Numpy array but is composed
of multiple discontigious buffers in memory.

The chunks are bits of data compressed as a whole, but that can be
decompressed partially in order to improve the fetching of small parts
of the array. This chunked nature of the carray objects, together with
a buffered I/O, makes appends very cheap and fetches reasonably fast
(although the modification of values can be an expensive operation).

The compression/decompression process is carried out internally by
Blosc, a high-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.
That ensures maximum performance for I/O operation.

    Data        |              | ctbytes
                +--------------+


The first 16 bytes in the buffer are the header of the chunk. The
first four are simply bytes, the last three are are each unsigned ints
(uint32) each occupying 4 bytes. The header is always little-endian.
'ctbytes' is the length of the buffer including header and nbytes is the
length of the data when uncompressed.
