Datashape
=========

.. highlight:: erlang

Datashape is a generalization of dtype and shape into a micro type
system which lets us describe the high-level structure of Table and
Array objects.

There are primitive machine types which on top of you can build
composite and dimensionalized structures::

    int32
    uint32
    complex64
    float
    pyobj

Fixed Dimensions
----------------

Fixed dimensions are just integer values at the top level of the
datatype. These are identical to ``shape`` parameters in numpy. ::

    2, int32

Is an length 2 array of the form::

    array([1, 2])

A 2 by 3 matrix matrix has datashape::

    2, 3, int32

With the corresponding Numpy array::

    array([[ 1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6]])

Constructors
------------

A type constructor is higher type that produces new named types from
arguments given. These are called **alias** types, they don't add any
additional structure they just provide a new name.::

    Dim2       = N, M
    Quaternion = 4, 4, int32

Once the types are registered they can be used in dtype expressions just
like primitive values and also to construct even higher order types.

For example a record of quaternions.::

    {x: Quaternion, y: Quaternion}

Notes. The free variables in a alias are unique only to the
constructor. For example composing the Dim2 constructor would
functionally create 4 variable dimensions *not* a 4 dimensional
structure with 2 rigid dimensions.::

    Dim, Dim2, int32 = a, b, c, d, int32

    # NOT THIS
    Dim, Dim2, int32 = a, b, a, b, int32

Record Types
------------

Record types are struct-like objects which hold a collection
of types keyed by labels. For example a pixel could be
representeed by::

    RGBA = {r: int32, g: int32, b: int32, a: int8}

Most importantly they are heterogenous.

Enumeration Types
-----------------

An enumeration provides a dimension which is specified by::

    Lengths = {1,2,3}
    Lengths * 3

This would correspond to a variable triangular table of
the form::

               3
             * * *
    Lengths    * *
                 *

Variable Length
---------------

The dual of the fixed length is a variable dimension which corresponds
to a unique yet undefined variable that is not specified.

Example 1::

    A, A, int32

Example 2::

    A, B, int32

The first example corresponds to a neccessarily square matrix of
integers while the later permits rectangular forms.

Ranged Length
-------------

Variable length types correspond where the dimension is not
known. ::

    ShortStrings = Var(0, 5)*char

For example ```5*ShortStrings``` might be a table of the form::

    foo
    bar
    fizz
    bang
    pop

Compounded variable lengths are **ragged tables**::

    Var(0,5), Var(0,5), int32

Would permit tables of the form::

    1 2 3 7 1
    1 4 5 8 1
    1 3 1 9 0
    1 2 2 0 0

Or::

    1 7
    1 1
    9 3

Under the same signature.

Stream Types
------------

A stream is a special case of ``Var`` where the upper bound is
infinity. It signifies a potentially infinite stream of elements.
``Stream(RGBA)`` might be stream of values from a photosensor. Where
each row represents a measurement at a given time::

    { 101 , 202 , 11  , 32 }
    { 50  , 255 , 11  , 0 }
    { 96  , 100 , 110 , 0 }
    { 96  , 50  , 60  , 0 }

Union Types
-----------

A union is a set of possible types, of which the actual value
will be exactly one of::

    IntOrChar  = Union(int32, char)
    StringLike = Union(char, string)

    Pixel = Union(
        {r: int32, g: int32, b: int32, a: int8},
        {h: int32, s: int32, v: int32},
    )

Nullable Types
--------------

A value that or may not be null is encoded as a ``Either``
constructor::

    MaybeFloat = Either float nan
    MaybeInt   = Either int32 nan

Pointer Types
-------------

**Work in Progress**

Pointers are dimension specifiers like machine types but where
the data is not in specified by value, but *by reference*. We use
adopt same notation as LLVM where the second argument is the
address space to reference.

Pointer to a integer in local memory::

    int32*

Pointer to a 4x4 matrix of integers in local memory::

    *(4, 4, int32)

Pointer to a record in local memory::

    *{x: int32, y:int32, label: string}

Pointer to integer in a shared memory segement keyed by 'foo'::

    *int32 (shm 'foo')

Pointer to integer on a array server 'bar'::

    *int32 (rmt array://bar)

Parametric Types
----------------

**Work in Progress**

The natural evolution is to support parametric types.

Which lets us have type constructors with free variables on the
left side of the constructor.::

    # Constructor
    Point T = {x: T, y: T}

    # Concrete instance
    Point int32 = {x: int32, y: int32}
