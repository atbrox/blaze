Blaze
=====

Blaze is coming soon! Look for updates around the end of November.

Blaze will be a free open source project, released under a BSD like license.

For more information and design principles, download and build the documentation:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

Or see the presentation from PyData: https://speakerdeck.com/sdiehl/blaze-next-generation-numpy

For a discussion of the underlying theory behind Blaze see the papers:

* [Chapel Language Specification](http://chapel.cray.com/spec/spec-0.775.pdf)
* [Regular, shape-polymorphic, parallel arrays in Haskell](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/repa.pdf)
