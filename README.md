Blaze
=====

Blaze is a work in progress at the moment. The code is quite a distance
from feature complete. The code is released in an effort to start a
public discussion with our end users and community.

Blaze is approaching being a usable library, but does not have runnable
components at the moment. Demos of usage will be available shortly after
the code is end-to-end complete.

Dependencies
------------

All dependencies will be resolved by working in the Anaconda
environment.

Free community edition is available here: http://continuum.io/downloads.html
