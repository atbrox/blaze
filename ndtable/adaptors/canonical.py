"""
Toy implementations of the "canonical backends".

These are purely for internal use, are never exposed to the end-user in
any form. Adaptors simply provide a layer over the low-level IO
operations needed to produce the bytes as needed.

They also hint at the memory properties of the underlying
substrate ( i.e sockets have chunked access, but are not
seekable ).

Going up and down in the hierarchy of memory-access involves costs.
Going from contiguous to stream involves seek operations, while going
from a stream to contiguous involves copying data.
