"""
Byte providers map a subset of the indexer space into low-level
IO operations.

The ByteProvider provides the high-level API operations on those bytes
that abstracts away the notion of whether the object is contiguous,
strided, or streamed and can extract or write bytes in any case.

If the DataDescriptor supports an operation natively then it can perform
it in a single "instruction", if it does not then the byte interface
will devise a way to do the operation as a sequence of instructions.
